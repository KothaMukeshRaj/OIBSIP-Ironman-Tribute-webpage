            <p>When <strong>Thanos</strong> invaded the earth, he made a lot of damages to the universe. Since all my avenger team members are <strong>USELESS</strong>, I had to take up the responsibility on my shoulder. I ended Thanos' entire MCU career with just a snap. Boom! But, in the process, I also <strong>died</strong> though it was not in my plan :( Don't scroll down without saying RIP.</p>

                <p>I rested in peace in the Avenger Endgame movie. In other words, Marvel fired me from MCU. However, with the inception of <strong>Multiverse</strong>, I am expecting to make a comeback. Without me, the current heros are having hard time understanding the Multiverse. I can lead them to understand it better.</p>
